**Abstract**

Marine classification schemes based on abiotic surrogates often inform regionalmarine conservation planning in lieu of detailed biological data. However, theseschemes may poorly represent ecologically relevant biological patterns required foreffective design and management strategies. We used a community-level modelingapproach to characterize and delineate representative mesoscale (tens to thousandsof kilometers) assemblages of demersal fish and benthic invertebrates in the North-west Atlantic. Hierarchical clustering of species occurrence data from four regionalannual multispecies trawl surveys revealed three to six groupings (predominantassemblage types) in each survey region, broadly associated with geomorphic andoceanographic features. Indicator analyses identified 3â€“34 emblematic taxa of eachassemblage type. Random forest classifications accurately predicted assemblage dis-tributions from environmental covariates (AUC > 0.95) and identified thermallimits (annual minimum and maximum bottom temperatures) as important pre-dictors of distribution in each region. Using forecasted oceanographic conditionsfor the year 2075 and a regional classification model, we projected assemblage dis-tributions in the southernmost bioregion (Scotian Shelf-Bay of Fundy) under ahigh emissions climate scenario (RCP 8.5). Range expansions to the northeastare projected for assemblages associated with warmer and shallower waters ofthe Western Scotian Shelf over the 21st century as thermal habitat on the rela-tively cooler Eastern Scotian Shelf becomes more favorable. Community-levelmodeling provides a biotic-informed approach for identifying broadscale ecolog-ical structure required for the design and management of ecologically coherent,representative, well-connected networks of Marine Protected Areas. When com-bined with oceanographic forecasts, this modeling approach provides a spatialtool for assessing sensitivity and resilience to climate change, which canimprove conservation planning, monitoring, and adaptive management.
